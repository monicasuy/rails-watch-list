# README

This is an application with the purpose of organising films into lists, like favourites, comedy, drama, etc. It is not 100% finished and there are things that could be improved, especially with the front-end
(the buttons could be improved and in general the pages look a bit basic, but my focus was the back-end while building this project).

In the back-end, I have used Ruby on Rails in order to create basic functionality to create lists and bookmarks, delete them and see the specific list created with the bookmarks. I created the routes first and then created the methods in the controllers and finally once the method was done, I did the corresponding view. As well as that, I set up Cloudinary so the users can choose the cover image for their list.

It is one of the projects I did in the bootcamp by myself when learning how Rails worked, so it might be
a bit basic, but it was incredibly useful to learn all things CRUD.

If I have more time, at some point I would like to add Rspec to it (TDD) so I could have tests for all the methods and functionality. I would also like to switch to using an API that allows the user to choose more films so there is more variety for the user to choose which films to include in their list.
